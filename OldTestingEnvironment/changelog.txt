The idea behind this directory is that this is where we test algorithms 
The top level script that runs everything calls the highest level makefile (empty as of now)
each algorithm is ran using a separate script file that runs tests and the output is recorded in a .csv file (not implemented yet).
There are 2 different algorithms so far to test this with.
