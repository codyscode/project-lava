	The main point of this was to separate the input queues from the output queues.
Initially I only did that but then there was some weird logic where threadIDs[],
threadArgs[], locks[], and finished[] were still on the old numbering system
(0 through m+n) while queues[] was on the new numbering system. I fixed this by
creating and intializing structs in global.h that encapsulate all these in an 
input struct and an output struct. So for example if you want to access output
queue 3 you would say output.queue[2] and if you want to lock on that thread
you would use output.locks[2].
	I noticed inputQueueCount and outputQueueCount were getting passed around as 
arguments a lot so I added them to the input/output structs and replaced all 
mentions with input.queueCount and output.queueCount. 
	I updated algorithm.c to use the modified framework and everything seems
to be working. Other than that I tried to change as little as possible.
You can use the same Makefile in this folder to test it out.

	-Added random number generator for generating the length member of the packet structure. 
		-Min payload size is 64 and max payload size is 9000
			-This translates to min packet struct size of 256 and max packet struct size of 9192

	-Added Comments to global.h file (no code added)

2/23/2019 - Alex
	-detached input and processing threads
	-Explicitly set expected array in process_thread() to all zeros
	-Included <string.h> in global.h file in order to use memset()
	-Included <math.h> in order to use in algorithm Files
	-Modified (added -lm) Makefile to work with <math.h> functions 

	Files modified: framework.c, global.h, Makefile

	- Implemented function to change the seed of rand(), so that our results aren't skewed towards a single data set
	- changed minimum payload size to 0, since there are packets that just transfer the header with no payload.
		- minimum packet struct size is now 24 and max is 9024 (in terms of bytes)
	- set expected[], line 96 in framework.c, to the order of the first packet it recieved 
	- moved original algorithm.c (singe wire algorithm) to newly created algorithm folder and renamed it to singleWire.c
	- detached main algorithm thread
	- defined HEADER_SIZE 24, line 36 in global.h. Defines first 24 bytes in packet header
	- changed length variable of packet to correspond to payload size instead of header size
	- implemented some error handling in the framework
	- changed globally defined variable to be represented in bytes. There was an issue in regards to calculating the size of the structures and the size
		in terms of bits and bytes were not consistent. I chose bytes since that's what most functions will use when calculating size.
	- tried testing out memcpy() for the current algorithm, but there seems to be issues possibly because of thread premption or memory ordering

2/24/2019 - Lito
	- changed this line $(CC) $(LDFLAGS) -c -o $@ $< $(CFLAGS)
	  $(CC) $(LDFLAGS) -std=c99 -c -o $@ $< $(CFLAGS)
	  So that the for loops don't have issues building on linux
	- changed asm to __asm__ because this is required for c99 as well.
	Files Modified: Makefile, global.h, testScript.sh
