	The main point of this was to separate the input queues from the output queues.
Initially I only did that but then there was some weird logic where threadIDs[],
threadArgs[], locks[], and finished[] were still on the old numbering system
(0 through m+n) while queues[] was on the new numbering system. I fixed this by
creating and intializing structs in global.h that encapsulate all these in an 
input struct and an output struct. So for example if you want to access output
queue 3 you would say output.queue[2] and if you want to lock on that thread
you would use output.locks[2].
	I noticed inputQueueCount and outputQueueCount were getting passed around as 
arguments a lot so I added them to the input/output structs and replaced all 
mentions with input.queueCount and output.queueCount. 
	I updated algorithm.c to use the modified framework and everything seems
to be working. Other than that I tried to change as little as possible.
You can use the same Makefile in this folder to test it out.

	-Added random number generator for generating the length member of the packet structure. 
		-Min payload size is 64 and max payload size is 9000
			-This translates to min packet struct size of 256 and max packet struct size of 9192

	-Added Comments to global.h file (no code added)
