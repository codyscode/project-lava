To use the framework:
    -Move an algoX.c from the algorithms folder into the frameworktest directory and name it algorithm.c
    -Do make clean (Needed because make has issues with similar file names)
    -Do make
    -run ./framework x y where x and y are positive numbers less than 9
    -Move the algorithm back into the algorithms folder and name it what it originally was. (Name is at the top of each algorithm file in comments)
