1. Updated inputLimitTest and outputLimitTest to work with new array-of-struct
setup.

2. In framework.c in input_thread():
	a. Added Alex's fast PRNG
	b. Added "packet_t *packet = &((*inputQueue).data[index]) and replaced
	all subsequent calls to (*inputQueue.data[index]) with packet.
	c. Change "wrap around" logic from index = index % BUFFERSIZE to
	if(index == BUFFERSIZE){ index = 0;}

3. In framework.c in processing_thread() did the same things as input_thread() not
including the PRNG
